# Deploy

Your Mailing server can be deployed as a production website ([example](http://demo.mailing.run/previews/AccountCreated/accountCreated)). The production build excludes development features like livereload and is optimized for performance.

### Why deploy?

- Share previews with clients and your team
- Email service with [REST API](/docs#rest-api)
- User-friendly email settings portals with [Lists](/docs/lists)
- [Coming soon] Analytics

## How to deploy

### Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your preview server is via Vercel's UI. Under the hood, mailing is a Next.js application and Vercel is great at hosting these. Configuring your deployment this way will also give you easy previews on PRs and automatic deployments from your main branch.

1. Create a new project on [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/)
2. Connect it to your git repository
3. Configure the build command to run `npx mailing server build`
4. Configure the output directory to be `.mailing/.next`

Here’s a working Vercel configuration:

/>

### Netlify

1. Install the Netlify NextJS plugin: `yarn add @netlify/plugin-nextjs`
2. Create a `netlify.toml` in your project root with the plugin enabled:

```bash netlify.toml
[[plugins]]
package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
```

3. In the Netlify deploy settings, set the "build command" to `yarn install && yarn mailing server build` and set "publish directory" to `.mailing/.next`

### Other hosts

If you want to deploy somewhere else, you can use `npx mailing server build` to build the production app and `npx mailing server start` to boot it on localhost.

## Adding a Database

Your mailing deploy is a perfectly useful way to view your email previews. But adding a database unlocks another level of functionality.

Adding a database to your Mailing deployment allows you to create an API key and perform priveleged actions. This includes paid Mailing Platform features as well as the ability to use the `sendMail` REST API, a free feature.

### 1. Deploy your Mailing server

See [above](/docs/deploy#how-to-deploy) if you haven't done this.

### 2. Connect a database

To use Lists, you’ll need to deploy mailing and connect
it to a postgres database by setting `MAILING_DATABASE_URL`
in your deploy environment. We recommend [neon.tech](https://neon.tech).
We’re happy to do this for you, ping in the discord and
we’ll set up a Neon database for you to connect to.
Because the API is serverless, it’s important that you use
a postgres service like neon that can handle a high number of connections.

### 3. Create an account

This secures your database. Navigate to /signup on your production instance of Mailing and set up a new account. This secures your deployment and will automatically create your Default list and an API key to use /api/sendMail as well. (Note: at the moment, we only allow one user to sign up per instance). If you need to login again in the future, visit /login. 4. Configure your clients with the api key. Any app that's calling sendMail is a client.

### 4. Set env variables

Set env variables in the environments you use `sendMail` from:

<CH.Section>

- _`MAILING_API_URL`_ - the url of your deployed mailing instance (e.g. "https://mailing.yourdomain.com")
- _`MAILING_API_KEY`_ - an api key from `$MAILING_API_URL/settings`

Example .env file:

```bash .env
MAILING_API_URL=https://mailing.yourdomain.com
MAILING_API_KEY=yourapikey
```

</CH.Section>
